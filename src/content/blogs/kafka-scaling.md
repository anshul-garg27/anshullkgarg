# Scaling Kafka Consumers for 10M+ Events/Day

When your event volume grows from thousands to millions per day, your Kafka consumer strategy needs to evolve. Here's what we learned.

## The Challenge

Our initial Kafka setup worked fine for low volumes, but as we scaled:
- Consumer lag started increasing
- Processing became uneven across partitions
- Memory usage spiked during peak hours

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Partition Strategy
```java
// Optimized partitioning by user_id
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(
    "events", 
    userId.hashCode() % partitionCount, 
    key, 
    value
));
```

### 2. Consumer Group Optimization
- Increased partition count from 3 to 24
- Tuned consumer group settings for better throughput
- Implemented proper error handling and retry logic

### 3. Backpressure Management
```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "events")
public void processEvent(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record) {
    // Implement circuit breaker pattern
    if (isSystemOverloaded()) {
        // Pause consumption temporarily
        return;
    }
    // Process event
}
```

## Results

The optimizations delivered impressive results:
- Processed 10M+ events/day consistently
- Consumer lag reduced to < 1 second
- 99.9% message processing success rate

Key takeaway: Plan for scale from day one, but optimize based on real usage patterns.
