# Innovative features (set you apart)

### 1) **Explorable Case Studies** (mini Flow Player)

For 1–2 projects, add a tiny **request-through-system** animation:

* Nodes: Client → API → Cache → DB → Queue.
* Toggles: “Cache miss”, “DB slow”, “Retry jitter”.
* Output: p95 waterfall changes & short explanation.
  (*Lightweight version of your “Explorable System Design” vision, right on the portfolio.*)

### 2) **Skill Proof Badges**

Each “Expert” skill shows **proof artifacts**: PR link, graph screenshot, short code sample. Helps recruiters trust levels.

### 3) **Impact Calculator**

A small widget: “Move your API from p95 320ms → 180ms at 1k RPS → saves ≈ X engineer hours/month”. Puts your work in business terms.

### 4) **Live Playground Links**

Tiny buttons to open stack-blitz/CodeSandbox for demo submodules (read-only). Great for URL shortener, ingest pipeline toy models.

### 5) **Interactive Resume Builder**

“Pick a role”, “Pick 3 projects” → auto-compose a 1-page PDF (md → PDF) with tailored bullets.

### 6) **“What I’m Learning” Log**

Changelog cards (“Upgraded Spring Boot 3.5.5 → resolved Tomcat CVE”, “Kafka exactly-once notes”). Feels authentic; keeps site fresh.

### 7) **Recruiter Shortcuts**

* `?dl=resume` param → instant download
* `?case=gcc-logging` → pre-open the corresponding modal
* Copy-to-clipboard for email/phone with a toast
